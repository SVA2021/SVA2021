Self-Taught Front-End Developer.

I like the process of turning an idea into a real thing, detail, device.\
This is the reason why I previously worked as a technologist (process engineer) for 10 years.\
I constantly strive to understand something new in technics and not only.\
Now I want to learn more about the structure of one of the most used technologies in the world in the 21st century - the **Internet**.
